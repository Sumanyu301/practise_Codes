// • You are given an array, whose size is stored in a variable with the name N
// • The array is stored in a variable with the name arr
// • You have to find the product of all the elements of the array, which are stored at odd indexes
// . For example, consider the value stored in N = 4, and the value stored in arr = [1,2,3,4]. Then, the elements stored at even indexes are 2,4, therefore, the product becomes 2*4 = 8, which is the required answer
// Note: Indexing in the array starts from 0
// Input
// The first line of the input contains the value stored in N
// • The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the value stored in arr
// Output
// • Print the product of all the elements in the array which are stored at odd indexes
// Sample Input 1
// 4
// 1 2 3 4
// Sample Output 1
// 8
